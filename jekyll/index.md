# Candidate susceptibility genes for complex traits in outbred rats

*This is a **beta version**. We are working on improving and expanding this portal.*

TWAS (transcriptome-wide association study) is an approach to estimate the genetic association between complex traits and transcriptomic variation. This web interface provides searchable access to TWAS results for many complex traits using GWAS and transcriptomic data from Heterogeneous Stock rats, produced by the [NIDA Center of Excellence for Genetics, Genomics, and Epigenetics of Substance Use Disorders in Outbred Rats (P30DA060810)](https://ratgenes.org/). The site is based on the original [TWAS hub](http://twas-hub.org/) for human data, with modifications including the addition of RNA phenotypes beyond gene expression levels using [Pantry](https://pantry.pejlab.org/).

**What can you do here?** Search the full list of analyzed traits and diseases in the <a class="border" href="{{ site.baseurl }}traits">TRAITS</a> tab. See all genes and loci associated with a given trait like <a class="border" href="{{ site.baseurl }}traits/novelty_seeking_test_total_velocity">Locomotion velocity, NPP test</a> and browse cross-trait associations. See gene conditional analyses at individual loci like <a class="border" href="{{ site.baseurl }}traits/novelty_seeking_test_total_velocity/2/">chr1:140,510,980-142,727,457</a> and filter all associated models. Evaluate predictive models for individual genes like <a class="border" href="{{ site.baseurl }}genes/ENSRNOG00000016496">Ctsc</a> and browse all corresponding trait associations. All genes with predictive models are listed in the <a class="border" href="{{ site.baseurl }}genes">GENES</a> tab.
See <a class="border" href="{{ site.baseurl }}usage/">USAGE</a> for a more detailed guide.
