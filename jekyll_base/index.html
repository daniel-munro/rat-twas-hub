<h1>candidate susceptibility genes for complex traits in outbred rats</h1>

<p>
<em>This is a <strong>beta version</strong>. It currently includes transcriptome models for only one rat tissue, whole brain hemisphere. It also includes only 18 GWAS traits from one study. We are working on expanding this portal.</em>

TWAS (transcriptome-wide association study) is an approach to estimate the genetic association between disease risk and the local gene expression of thousands of genes. This web interface provides searchable access to TWAS results from complex traits and gene expression in Heterogeneous Stock rats. It is based on the original <a href="http://twas-hub.org/">TWAS hub</a> for human data.

<b>What can you do here?</b> Search the full list of analyzed traits and diseases in the <a class="border" href="{{ site.baseurl }}traits">TRAITS</a> tab. See all genes and loci associated with a given trait like <a class="border" href="{{ site.baseurl }}traits/open_field_dist2ctrtotal">Open field: Total distance to center zone</a> and browse cross-trait associations. See gene conditional analyses at individual loci like <a class="border" href="{{ site.baseurl }}traits/open_field_dist2ctrtotal/1/">chr4:56,925,659-58,324,809</a> and filter all associated models. Evaluate predictive models for individual genes like <a class="border" href="{{ site.baseurl }}genes/ENSRNOG00000018824">Slc7a5</a> and browse all corresponding trait associations. All genes with predictive models are listed in the <a class="border" href="{{ site.baseurl }}genes">GENES</a> tab.
